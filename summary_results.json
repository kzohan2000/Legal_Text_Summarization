                "summary": "\nIt was, therefore, beyond doubt that in the event an application is made by the accused, the court would be obliged to summon the person giving evidence on affidavit in terms of Section 145(1) without having any discretion in the matter.\n\nSuch safeguards are:\n     (a) that no court shall take cognizance of such offence except on a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque;\n     (b) that such complaint is made within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises; and      (c) that no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class shall try any such offence.\"\n12.\nNotwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), all offences under this Chapter shall be tried by a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class or by a Metropolitan Magistrate and the provisions of Sections 262 to 265 (both inclusive) of the said Code shall, as far as may be, apply to such trials:\nMr Bhatnagar submitted that since Section 145(2) is identical to Section 296(2) of the Code, it should be interpreted in the light of the legislative history of Section 296(2) and he tried to take us into the details of the legislative his- tory of Section 296 of the Code.\nHe further submitted that the plain language of Section 145(2) was clear and unambiguous and was capable of only one meaning and, therefore, the provision must be understood in its literl sense and the High Court was in error in resorting to purposive interpretation of the provision.\n(2) The court may, if it thinks fit, and shall, on the application of the prosecution or the accused, summon and ex- amine any person giving evidence on affidavit as to the facts contained therein.\n(3) Every trial under this section shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible and an endeavour shall be made to conclude the trial within six months from the date of filing of the complaint.\nIn that case, the drawer, without prejudice to the other provisions of the said Act, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to twice the  punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.\nHe also submit- ted that ordinarily the rule of literal construction should not be departed from, particularly when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous.\nSection 145 with its non obstante clause, as noted above, makes it possible for the evidence of the com- plainant to be taken in the absence of the accused.\n\nOnce it is realised that Sections 143 to 147 were designed especially to lay down a much simplified procedure for the trial of dishonoured cheque cases with the sole object that the trial of those cases should follow a course even swifter than a summary trial and once it is seen that even the special procedure failed to effectively and expeditiously handle the vast multitude of cases coming to the court, the claim of the accused that on being summoned under Section 145(2), the complainant or any of his witnesses whose evidence is given on affidavit must be made to depose in examination-in-chief all over again plainly appears to be a demand for meaningless duplication, apparently aimed at delaying the trial.\n\nEven while following the procedure of summary trials, the non obstante clause and the ex- pression \"as far as possible\" used in Section 143 coupled with the non obstante clause in Section 145 allow for the evidence of the complainant to be given on affidavit, that is, in the absence of the accused.\n39. Moreover, the crucial difference between Section 296(2) of the Code and Section 145(2) of the Act is that the former deals with the evidence of a formal nature whereas under the latter provision, all evidences includ- ing substantive evidence may be given on affidavit.\n\nEven though the legislature in their wisdom did not deem it proper to incorporate the word \"accused with the word \"complainant\" in Section 145(1), it did not mean that the Magistrate could not allow the ac- cused to give his evidence on affidavit by applying the same analogy unless there was a just and reasonable ground to refuse such permission.\n\nNeither the legislative history of Section 296(2) nor any decision on that section can persuade us to hold that under Section 145(2) of the Act, on being summoned at the instance of the accused the com- plainant or any of his witnesses should be first made to depose in examination-in-chief before cross- examination.\n\nNeither Section 296(2) of the Code nor the decision in Naib Din (2001) 8 SCC 578 has any relevance or application to the trial concerning a dishonoured cheque under Sections 143 to 146 of the Act.\n\nThe accused, however, is fully protected, as under sub- section (2) of Section 145 he has the absolute and unqualified right to have the complainant and any or all of his witnesses summoned for    cross-examination.\nIt is, however, significant that the procedure of summary trials is adopted under Section 143 subject to the qualification \"as far as possible\", thus, leaving sufficient flexibility so as not to affect the quick flow of the qualification \"as far as possible, thus, leaving sufficient flexibility so as not to affect the quick flow of the trial process.\n\nHence, on being summoned on the application made by the accused the deponent of the affidavit (the complainant or any of his witnesses) can only be subjected to cross-examination as to the facts stated in the affidavit.\n\nIn case the complainant's affidavits contain statements that are not admissible in evidence, it is always open to the accused to point those out to the court and the court would then surely deal with the objections in accor- dance with law.\n\nSection 296 is part of the elaborate procedure of a regular trial under the Code while the whole object of Section 145(2) of the Act is to design a much simpler and swifter trial procedure departing from the elaborate and time-consuming trial procedure of the Code.\n\nIt is, therefore, wrong to equate the defence evidence with the complainant's evidence and to extend the same option to the accused as well.\n\n(b) Cases under Section 498-A of the Penal Code, 1860.\n\n(c) Cases under Section 143 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\n\nThe courts are unable to dispose of such cases expeditiously in a time-bound manner in view of the procedure contained in the Act.\n\n2. A large number of cases are reported to be pending under Sections 138 to 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in various courts in the country.\n\nSection 144 makes the process of service of summons simpler and cuts down the long time ordinarily consumed in service of summons in a regular civil suit or a criminal trial.\n\nIt is for the court to take a decision, whether he be imprisoned for one year, or double the amount that would be paid as fine or both things will have to be taken together.\n\nA remedial measure was urgently required and the legislature took action by introducing further amendments in the Act by the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002.\n\nThis would have been impermissible (even in a summary trial under the Code of Criminal Procedure) in view of Sections 251 and 254 and especially Section 273 of the Code.\n\nIn other words, anything inadmissible in evi- dence e.g irrelevant facts or hearsay matters would not be taken in as evidence, even though stated on affidavit.\n"

                "summary": "\nMr Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the appellant in appeal arising from Slp (Crl.) No. 4760 of 2006 pointed out that sub-section (2) of Section 145 uses both the words, \"may\" (with ref- erence to the court) and shall (with reference to the prosecution or the accused).\nThe extent of the right of the accused under Section 145(2) of the Act: whether the right of the accused is limited to cross-examination of any person giving evidence on affidavit or is it open to the accused to insist that notwith- standing the evidence earlier given on affidavit, on coming to the court the complainant or his witness should first give deposition in examination-in-chief before being cross-examined by him?\nThis, ac- cording to him, coupled with the use of the word shall with reference to the application made by the ac- cused made it quite clear that a person giving his evidence on affidavit, on being summoned under Section 145(2) at the instance of the accused must begin his deposition with examination-in-chief, before he may be cross-examined by the accused.\nThe plea for a literal interpretation of Section 145(2) is based on the unfounded assumption that the language of the section clearly says that the person giving his evidence on affidavit, on being summoned at the instance of the accused must start his deposition in court with examination-in-chief.\n145.\n\nIn support of the submission he relied upon the de- cisions of this Court in Dental Council of India v. Hari Prakash (2001) 8 SCC 61 and Nathi Devi v. Radha Devi Gupta.\n\nMr Ranjit Kumar next submitted that Section 145(2) was identical to Section 296(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and this Court, in its decision in State Of Punjab v.
